# Get a bird's eye view of your tabs and switch between them easily

This extension is a poor man's replacement of Firefox's now defunct Tab Groups
extension. When activated (using the `Ctrl-Shift-D` keybinding), it'll display
a visual overview of all tabs in the current window, and allow switching between
them either by clicking, or using the keyboard (by typing a tab's name/url and
pressing the `Return` key).

This extension is currently in a very rough state, improvements might come if I
end up using it regularly enough.
